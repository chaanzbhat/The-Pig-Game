# The-Pig-Game: A Fun Game built using Javascript

<strong>Pig Game Rules:</strong>

Pig is a simple dice game which in its basic form is playable with just a single die. You win by being the first player to score 100 or more points.

<strong>Skull dice (where the 1 is replaced with a skull) work well for this game.</strong>

<strong>So how do you play Pig?</strong>
<ol>
  <li>Choose a player to go first.</li>
  <li>That player throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesnâ€™t roll a 1.</li>
  <li>The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.</li>
  <li>If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.</li>
  <li>Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.</li>
</ol>

<strong>How do you win?</strong>
The first player to accumulate 100 or more points wins the game.
